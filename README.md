# 🚦 Road Accident Insights – Tableau Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive **data visualization dashboard** built using Tableau to analyze **road accident patterns** based on time, location, severity, and conditions. It helps uncover insights into **when**, **where**, and **how** accidents occur, allowing stakeholders to make **data-driven decisions** for improving road safety.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview
